I'm working through the apparently timeless classic of computer science, SICP_, until I finish or get bored of it, whichever happens first. Thanks to twcamper on GitHub for making an `ebook reader-compatible version`_ of SICP.

I'm using Racket_ because I found `Matthew Butterick's case for it`_ compelling. Also the `quick introduction`_ on the Racket homepage is pretty great.
